			<p>The cloak of Hope is an unfortunate classpect. Pre-game, the Cloak of Hope will likely spend most of their time searching for something that they're talented at. They will jump from thing to thing, and if they aren't immediately good at it, they completely abandon it. They will likely be unhappy with this, but will do nothing to change it.
